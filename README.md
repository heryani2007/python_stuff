CS50P > Python MOOC > Python Crash Course > 100 Days of Code

CS50P (8/10) - Not beginer friendly but rapid. 
Python MOOC - In progress. I like that advanced concepts like functional decomposition and information hiding, recursion etc are covered.
Python Crash Course (7/10) - Too beginer friendly does not cover exception handeling well and does not cover sys.argv()
100 Days of Code (5/10) - No eplenation of what code is doing. Just expects you to "Google it". If I wanted to do that I wouldnt have joined the course lol. Pros are that the course covers a very wide range of topics
